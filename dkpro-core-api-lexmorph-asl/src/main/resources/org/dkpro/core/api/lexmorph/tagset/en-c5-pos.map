# Default mapping
*=POS

# AJ0	Adjective (general or positive) (e.g. good, old, beautiful)
AJ0=POS_ADJ
AJ0-AV0=POS_ADJ
AJ0-VVG=POS_ADJ
AJ0-VVN=POS_ADJ
AJ0-VVD=POS_ADJ
AJ0-NN1=POS_ADJ

# AJC	Comparative adjective (e.g. better, older)
AJC=POS_ADJ

# AJS	Superlative adjective (e.g. best, oldest)
AJS=POS_ADJ

# AT0	Article (e.g. the, a, an, no) [N.B. no is included among articles, which are defined here as
#       determiner words which typically begin a noun phrase, but which cannot occur as the head of
#       a noun phrase.]
AT0=POS_DET

# AV0	General adverb: an adverb not subclassified as AVP or AVQ (see below) (e.g. often, well, 
#       longer (adv.), furthest. [Note that adverbs, unlike adjectives, are not tagged as positive, 
#       comparative, or superlative.This is because of the relative rarity of comparative and
#       superlative adverbs.]
AV0=POS_ADV
AV0-AJ0=POS_ADV

# AVP	Adverb particle (e.g. up, off, out) [N.B. AVP is used for such "prepositional adverbs", 
#       whether or not they are used idiomatically in a phrasal verb: e.g. in 'Come out here' and 
#       'I can't hold out any longer', the same AVP tag is used for out.
AVP-PRP=POS_ADP

# AVQ	Wh-adverb (e.g. when, where, how, why, wherever) [The same tag is used, whether the word
# occurs in interrogative or relative use.]
AVQ-CJS=POS_ADV

CJC=POS_CONJ

# CJS	Subordinating conjunction (e.g. although, when)
CJS=POS_SCONJ
CJS-AVQ=POS_SCONJ
CJS-PRP=POS_SCONJ


# CJT	The subordinating conjunction that [N.B. that is tagged CJT when it introduces not only a 
#       nominal clause, but also a relative clause, as in 'the day that follows Christmas'. Some 
#       theories treat that here as a relative pronoun, whereas others treat it as a conjunction. We
#       have adopted the latter analysis.]
CJT=POS_SCONJ
CJT-DT0=POS_SCONJ

# CRD	Cardinal number (e.g. one, 3, fifty-five, 3609)
CRD=POS_NUM
CRD-PNI=POS_NUM

# DPS	Possessive determiner (e.g. your, their, his)
DPS=POS_DET

# DT0	General determiner: i.e. a determiner which is not a DTQ. [Here a determiner is defined as a
#       word which typically occurs either as the first word in a noun phrase, or as the head of a
#       noun phrase. E.g. This is tagged DT0 both in 'This is my house' and in 'This house is 
#       mine'.]
DT0=POS_DET
DT0-CJT=POS_DET


# DTQ	Wh-determiner (e.g. which, what, whose, whichever) [The category of determiner here is

#       nouns such as committee and team are tagged NN0, on the grounds that they are capable of
#       taking singular or plural agreement with the following verb: e.g. 'The committee disagrees/
#       disagree'.]
NN0=POS_NOUN

# NN1	Singular common noun (e.g. pencil, goose, time, revelation)
NN1=POS_NOUN
NN1-VVG=POS_NOUN

# NN2	Plural common noun (e.g. pencils, geese, times, revelations)
NN2=POS_NOUN
NN2-VVZ=POS_NOUN

# NP0	Proper noun (e.g. London, Michael, Mars, IBM) [N.B. the distinction between singular and 
#       plural proper nouns is not indicated in the tagset, plural proper nouns being a comparative
#       rarity.]
NP0=POS_PROPN
NP0-NN1=POS_PROPN

# ORD	Ordinal numeral (e.g. first, sixth, 77th, last) . [N.B. The ORD tag is used whether these

#       are also assigned to this category.]
ORD=POS_NUM

# PNI	Indefinite pronoun (e.g. none, everything, one [as pronoun], nobody) [N.B. This tag applies
#       to words which always function as [heads of] noun phrases. Words like some and these, which
#       can also occur before a noun head in an article-like function, are tagged as determiners
#       (see DT0 and AT0 above).]
PNI=POS_PRON
PNI-CRD=POS_PRON

# PNP	Personal pronoun (e.g. I, you, them, ours) [Note that possessive pronouns like ours and 
#       theirs are tagged as personal pronouns.]

#       they occur in interrogative or in relative use.]

PNN=POS_PRON

#       sequence of tags is: NP0 POS CJC PNI AV0 POS)

#       function, of is assigned a special tag of its own.
PRF=POS_ADP
