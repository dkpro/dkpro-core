There should only be files with the naming scheme:

	language-tagset-tool.map
	
For historical reasons, there are also

	language-tool.map
	language-default-tool.map

These two files should always be identical (as long as they are not completely removed) and they
should be identical to one of the language-tagset-tool.map files - the most commonly used one.
