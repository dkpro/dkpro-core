     * The Word class represents strings that are tokens or words. A string is a Word, if it is a
     * word. We don't nitpic about whether it is a a pronoun, a name, a punctuation mark or an
     * apostrophe or whether it is separated by white space from another Word or something else. The
     * string 'He enters the room.' for example has 5 words. Words are assigned by a tokenizer NIF
     * Implementation. Single word phrases might be tagged as nif:Word and nif:Phrase.
     * 
     * Example 1: "The White House" are three Words separated by whitespace

     * Comment 1: We adopted the definition style from foaf:Person, see here:
     * http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/#term_Person We are well aware that the world out there is much
     * more complicated, but we are ignorant about it, for the following reasons:
     * 
     * Comment 2:
     * 
     * 1. NIF has a client-server and the client has the ability to dictate the tokenization to the
     * server (i.e. the NIF Implementation) by sending properly tokenized NIF annotated with
     * nif:Word. All NIF Implementations are supposed to honor and respect the current assignment of
     * the Word class. Thus the client should decide which NIF Implementation should create the
     * tokenization. Therefore this class is not descriptive, but prescriptive.
     * 
     * 2. The client may choose to send an existing tokenization to a NIF Implementation, with the
     * capability to change (for better or for worse) the tokenization.
     * 
     * The class has not been named 'Token' as the NLP definition of 'token' is descriptive (and not
     * well-defined), while the assignment of what is a Word and what not is prescriptive, e.g.
     * "can't" could be described as one, two or three tokens or defined as being one, two or three
     * words. For further reading, we refer the reader to: By all these lovely tokens... Merging
     * conflicting tokenizations by Christian Chiarcos, Julia Ritz, and Manfred Stede. Language
     * Resources and Evaluation 46(1):53-74 (2012) or the short form:
     * http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W09-3005
     * 
     * There the task at hand is to merge two tokenization T_1 and T_2 which is normally not the
     * case in the NIF world as tokenization is prescribed, i.e. given as a baseline (Note that this
     * ideal state might not be achieved by all implementations.)
