description: |
  This is the data from the CoNLL-2000 shared task on text chunking.
  The data consists of the same partitions of the Wall Street Journal corpus (WSJ) as the widely 
  used data for noun phrase chunking: sections 15-18 as training data (211727 tokens) and section
  20 as test data (47377 tokens). The annotation of the data has been derived from the WSJ corpus 
  by a program written by Sabine Buchholz from Tilburg University, The Netherlands. Instead of using
  the part-of-speech tags of the WSJ corpus, the data set used tags generated by the Brill tagger.

  NOTE: We did not find any license information for this dataset. However, as the texts appear to
        come from the WSJ corpus, probably the WSJ corpus license applies here.
