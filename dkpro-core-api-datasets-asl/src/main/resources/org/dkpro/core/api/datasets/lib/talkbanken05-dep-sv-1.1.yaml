description: |
  Talbanken05 is a modernized version of Talbanken76, a Swedish treebank of roughly 300,000 words,
  constructed at Lund University in the 1970s. The treebank comes with no guarantee but is freely
  available for research and educational purposes as long as proper credit is given for the work
  done to produce the material (both in Lund and in Växjö).

  Dep: Dependency structure annotation (CoNLL-X shared task format in UTF-8).
