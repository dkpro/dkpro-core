description: |
  Version 1 (the directory "da") was orginally called the Danish
  Dependency Treebank. It was used in the CoNLL 2006 shared task on
  dependency parsing, but has since been updated with bug fixes and an
  improved CoNLL conversion which includes a decomposition of the
  PAROLE part-of-speech tags into the underlying features for number,
  gender, etc.).
