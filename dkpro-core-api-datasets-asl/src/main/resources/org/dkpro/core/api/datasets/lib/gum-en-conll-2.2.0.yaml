description: |
  This dataset contains release versions of the Georgetown University Multilayer Corpus (GUM), a 
  corpus of English texts from four text types (interviews, news, travel guides, instructional
  texts). The corpus is created as part of the course LING-367 (Computational Corpus Linguistics) at
  Georgetown University. For more details see: http://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/gum.
  
  The dep layer gives a dependency syntax analysis according to the Stanford Dependencies manual.
  This layer was intially produced using the Stanford Parser and then manually corrected using the
  Arborator collaborative syntax annotation software. For the annotation project we used
  non-collapsed dependencies, and dependencies for punctuation tokens have been removed.
