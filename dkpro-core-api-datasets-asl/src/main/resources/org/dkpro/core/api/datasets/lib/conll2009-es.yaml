description: |
  This is a subset of the Ancora corpus (see http://clic.ub.edu/ancora) which was used in the 
  CoNLL-2009 shared task on extracting syntactic and semantic Dependencies in multiple languages.

  528,440 lexical tokens; training: 427,442; development: 50,368; test: 50,630

  (This description has been partially copied from the README file included with the corpus).

  NOTE: The description states that the data was extracted from the Ancora corpus, but it does not
        say from which version. One might assume it comes from AnCora Spanish dependency 1.0.1. However,
        this version does not include a license file. The next version is AnCora Catalan 2.0.0 which
        was released under GPL 3.0. Thus, one might conclude that this data can also be
        used under these conditions.
