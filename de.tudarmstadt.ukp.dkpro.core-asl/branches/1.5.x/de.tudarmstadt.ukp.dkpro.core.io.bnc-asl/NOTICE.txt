Dear Martin,

we have implemented a component for reading BNC XML files as part of our open source project DKPro 
Core [1]. Would it be possible to include the example BNC file 
http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/docs/eg.xml in the project, so that it can be used to by unit tests to 
check if our component works properly? Of course we would add a prominent notice in the file
stating its source.

Best regards,

Dear Richard,

Yes, that would be fine. We encourage the use of fragments and examples 
from the corpus, which can be published and incorporated in other products.

Best wishes,
Martin
