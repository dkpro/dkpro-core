     * Setting this to something higher than 1, will linearly scale down the returned frequency counts.
     * E.g. setting it to 10, will return 1/10 of the actual frequency counts.
     * This way, smaller n-gram models can be estimated.
     * 
     * The same functionality could be implemented in the components using the provider,
     *   but they all needed to be aware of that down-scaling then which is undesirable.
     * However, it might be much faster, as the actual frequency count only needs to be retrieved once,
     *   and different down-scaling factors can be tried instantly.
     * So in some situations, it might be more efficient to return the unscaled score and do it yourself.
     * 
     * Keep in mind that the resulting n-gram model is only a rough estimate of a really down-scaled model.
     * Especially normalizing with the number of n-grams will not give exact results,
     *   as some of them now have zero counts and should not be counted.
     * As long as one stays within the same n-gram model, the effects should be relative and can be ignored.
     * However, comparing the relative frequencies from a down-scaled model with another model is invalid.
