== Type System

=== Adding a type

To add a new type, first locate the relevant module. Typically types are added to an *API* module
because types are supposed to be independent of individual analysis tools. In rare circumstances,
a type may be added to an I/O or tool module, e.g. because the type is experimental and needs to
be tested in the context of that module - or because the type is highly specific to that module.

Typically, there is only a single descriptor file called `dkpro-types.xml`. Within a module, we keep
this descriptor in the folder `src/main/resources` under the top-level package plus _type_ name of
the module. E.g. for the module 

    de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.api.semantics-asl

the type descriptor would be 

    src/main/resources/de/tudarmstadt/ukp/dkpro/core/api/semantics/type/dkpro-types.xml

NOTE: For the time being, descriptors in `src/main/resources/desc/type` are also supported. 
      However, this support is going to be removed in the future.

When a new type system descriptor has been added to a module, it needs to be registered with 
uimaFIT. This happens by creating the file

    src/main/resources/META-INF/org.apache.uima.fit/types.txt
    
consisting of a list of type system descriptor locations prefixed with `classpath*:`, e.g.:

    classpath*:de/tudarmstadt/ukp/dkpro/core/api/semantics/type/dkpro-types.xml

NOTE: The type system location corresponds to the location within the classpath at runtime, thus
      `src/main/resources` is stripped from the beginning.

=== JCas classes

Instead of pre-generating the JCas classes and storing them in the version control, we use the
_jcasgen-maven-plugin_ to automatically generate JCas classes at build time. The automatic
generation of JCas classes need to be explictily enabled for modules containing types. This
is done by placing a file called `.activate-run-jcasgen` in the module root with the content
    
    Marker to activate run-jcasgen profile.
    
NOTE: Actually the content is irrelevant, but it is a good idea to place a note here regarding the
      purpose of the file.

However, in some we customized the JCas classes, e.g. we added the method 
`DocumentMetaData.get(JCas)`. Such classes are excluded from being generated automatically by
placing them in a second descriptor file called `dkpro-types-customized.xml`, e.g.

    src/main/resources/de/tudarmstadt/ukp/dkpro/core/api/semantics/type/dkpro-types-customized.xml
    
NOTE: The `dkpro-types-customized.xml` descriptor must be also registered with uimaFIT in the 
      `types.txt` file.
