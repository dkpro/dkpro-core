== Models and Resources

==== Packaging models

Most models used by DKPro Core are available through our Maven repository. However, in some cases,
we cannot redistribute the models. For these cases, we provide Ànt-based `build.xml` scripts that
automatically download and package the models for use with DKPro Core.

For any given module supporting packaged resources, there is always the build.xml in SVN
trunk and the ones in previous releases (tags folder) in SVN. Which one should you use? 

You should always use only the `build.xml` files belonging to the verison of DKPro Core that you
are using. From time to time, we change the metadata within these files and DKPro Core may be 
unable to properly resolve models belonging to a different version of DKPro Core. The files are
contained in the `src/scripts` folder of the respective modules in SVN. We do not ship the 
`build.xml` files in any other way than via SVN. 

That said, it might be necessary to make modifications to a `build.xml` file if it refers to files
that are changed by upstream. E.g. the TreeTagger models tend to change without their name or
version changing. Also, sometimes upstream files may become unavailable. In such cases, you have
to update the MD5 hash for the model in the `build.xml` file or even to comment it out entirely.

In case you need to update MD5 sum, you should also update the `upstreamVersion` to correspond to
the date of the new model. A good way to determine the date of the latest change is using the
`curl` tool, e.g.:

    curl -I http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/models-1.5/en-pos-maxent.bin
    
In the output locate `Last-Modified` line

    Last-Modified: Thu, 09 Sep 2010 06:57:11 GMT
    
So, here the `upstreamVersion` for `en-pos-maxent.bin` should be set to `20100909` (YYYYMMDD).
