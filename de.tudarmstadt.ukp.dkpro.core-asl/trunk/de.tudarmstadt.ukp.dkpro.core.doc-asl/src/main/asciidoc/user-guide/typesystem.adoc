== Type System

The DKPro Core type system forms the interface between all the integrated components.
Components store and retrieve their data from the UIMA CAS based on this type system. The
type system design is using a rather flat hierarchy and a mostly loose coupling between
annotations. It is offered as a set of modules, not as a single monolithic type system.

==== DocumentMetaData

The DocumentMetaData annotation stores information about a single processed
document. There can only be one of these annotations per CAS. The annotation is
created by readers and contains information to uniquely identify the document from
which a CAS was created. Writer components use this information when determining
under which filename a CAS is stored.

There are two principle ways of identifying a document:

* collection id / document id: this simple system identifies a document
  within a collection. The ID of the collection and the document are each
  simple strings without any further semantics such as e.g. a hierarchy. For
  this reason, this identification scheme is not well suited to preserve
  information about directory structures.


* document base URI / document URI: this system identifies a document using
  a URI. The base URI is used to derive the relative path of the document with
  respect to the base location from where it has been read. E.g. if the base
  URI is __file:/texts__ and the document URI is __file:/texts/english/text1.txt__, then the relativ
  path of the document is __english/text1.txt__. This
  information is used by writers to recreate the directory structure found
  under the base location in the target location.

It is possible and indeed common for a writer to initialize both systems of
identification. If both systems are present, most writers default to using the
URI-based systems. However, most writers also allow forcing the use of the ID-based
systems.



==== TagsetDescription and TagDescription


[NOTE]
====
Recording tagset and tag descriptions in the CAS is still a feature under
development. It is not supported by all components and it is not yet well
defined. Expect changes and enhancements to this feature in future versions of
DKPro Core.

==== Named entities

Named entities refer e.g. to persons, locations, organizations and so on. They often
consist of multiple tokens. 


==== Semantic fields

The SemanticField is a coarse-grained semantic category that can be attached to
nouns, verbs or adjectives. Semantic field information is present e.g. in WordNet as
lexicographer file names. Previously, this kind of semantic information has also
been called supersenses or semantic types.


==== Semantic argument structure

The SemanticPredicate annotation can be attached to predicates in a sentences.
Semantic predicates express events or situations and take semantic arguments
expressing the participants in these events ore situations. All forms of main verbs
can be annotated with a SemanticPredicate. However, there are also many nouns and
adjectives that take arguments and can thus be annotated with a SemanticPredicate,
e.g. event nouns, such as "suggestion" (with arguments what and by whom), or
relational adjectives, such as "proud" (with arguments who and of what). The
SemanticArgument annotation is attached to semantic arguments of semantic
predicates. Semantic arguments are characterized by their semantic role, e.g. Agent,
Experiencer, Topic. The semantic role of an argument is related to its semantic type
(for communication verbs, the Agent can be a person or an organization, but
typically not food). The semantic type of arguments is not yet covered by the
SemanticType.
