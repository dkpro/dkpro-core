# == Clause level ==
# S - simple declarative clause, i.e. one that is not introduced by a (possible empty) subordinating 
#     conjunction or a wh-word and that does not exhibit subject-verb inversion.
# SBAR - Clause introduced by a (possibly empty) subordinating conjunction.
# SBARQ - Direct question introduced by a wh-word or a wh-phrase. Indirect questions and relative 
#         clauses should be bracketed as SBAR, not SBARQ.
# SINV - Inverted declarative sentence, i.e. one in which the subject follows the tensed verb or 
#        modal.
# SQ - Inverted yes/no question, or main clause of a wh-question, following the wh-phrase in SBARQ.

# == Phrase level ==
# ADJP - Adjective Phrase.
# ADVP - Adverb Phrase.
# CONJP - Conjunction Phrase.
# FRAG - Fragment.
# INTJ - Interjection. Corresponds approximately to the part-of-speech tag UH.
# LST - List marker. Includes surrounding punctuation.
# NAC - Not a Constituent; used to show the scope of certain prenominal modifiers within an NP.
# NP - Noun Phrase. 
# NX - Used within certain complex NPs to mark the head of the NP. Corresponds very roughly to 
#      N-bar level but used quite differently.
# PP - Prepositional Phrase.
# PRN - Parenthetical. 
# PRT - Particle. Category for words that should be tagged RP. 
# QP - Quantifier Phrase (i.e. complex measure/amount phrase); used within NP.
# RRC - Reduced Relative Clause. 
# UCP - Unlike Coordinated Phrase. 
# VP - Vereb Phrase. 
# WHADJP - Wh-adjective Phrase. Adjectival phrase containing a wh-adverb, as in how hot.
# WHAVP - Wh-adverb Phrase. Introduces a clause with an NP gap. May be null (containing the 0 
#         complementizer) or lexical, containing a wh-adverb such as how or why.
# WHNP - Wh-noun Phrase. Introduces a clause with an NP gap. May be null (containing the 0 
#        complementizer) or lexical, containing some wh-word, e.g. who, which book, whose daughter,
#        none of which, or how many leopards.
# WHPP - Wh-prepositional Phrase. Prepositional phrase containing a wh-noun phrase (such as of 
#        which or by whose authority) that either introduces a PP gap or is contained by a WHNP.
# X - Unknown, uncertain, or unbracketable. X is often used for bracketing typos and in bracketing
#     the...the-constructions.
