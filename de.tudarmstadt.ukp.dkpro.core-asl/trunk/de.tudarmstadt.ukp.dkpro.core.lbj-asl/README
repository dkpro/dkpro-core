Unfortunately, this module cannot be included in DKPro Core releases. 

The lbj modules are not available from Maven Central. They cannot be build directly
from the source code. Lbj is special in the sense that it does not have model files, 
as other tools, but rather generates Java source code from training data, which is
then compiled directly into the tool. Since we cannot build it from source, we cannot
do a propery third-party deploy to Maven Central.

We'll keep the module in the trunk though.
