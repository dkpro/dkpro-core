  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>Many powerful and state-of-the-art NLP tools are already freely available in the NLP
		research community. New and improved tools are being developed and released continuously.
		The tools cover the whole range of NLP-related processing tasks. DKPro Core provides UIMA
		components wrapping these tools so they can be used interchangeably in processing pipelines.
		DKPro Core builds heavily on uimaFIT which allows for rapid and easy development of
		UIMA-based NLP processing pipelines.</para>
