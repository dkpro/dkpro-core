The art of playing the dhak is now being referred to as a dying profession .
While some of the dhakis may be lucky to retain old contacts , many are facing a decline and some are moving away from the traditional profession . 
They look down upon such misadventures of the younger generation , but do not have an alternative before themselves .
Today , we are just another component of the Puja paraphernalia , who are supposed to perform on those days .
Earlier , they used to be from around Mahalaya , but now go only for the five days .
The killing increases with each passing year .
The feathers of wild birds play an indispensable role in controlling pests .
All the birds killed are protected species and the open bill stork is endangered .
The law exists , but law keepers turn a blind eye to it .
Even a small pandal without the beat of dhaks is unimaginable .
Durga Puja does not assume the festive aura without the maddening beats of the dhak , the large drum that men hang around their necks and play with two thin sticks to infuse the frenzied rhythm into listeners .
Those enchanting beats are enough to conjure up the sights and smells of Durga Puja .
The nuances of playing the instrument are handed down from generation to generation , but the old rhythms are undergoing changes .
Dhakis who cannot learn within the family typically take training under a guru in order to become a good dhaki , as is the case for most musical instruments .
Some take six months to become mature players , while others do not even learn after three or four years .
Many young dhakis nowadays are moving towards modern rhythms .
But most know the basic rhythms that have been taught to them by their ancestors .
