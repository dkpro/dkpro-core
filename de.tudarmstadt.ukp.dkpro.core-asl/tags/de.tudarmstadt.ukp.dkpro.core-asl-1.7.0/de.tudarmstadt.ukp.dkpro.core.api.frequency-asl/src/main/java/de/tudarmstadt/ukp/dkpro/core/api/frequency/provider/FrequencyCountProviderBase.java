     * Setting this to something higher than 1, will linearly scale down the returned frequency
     * counts. E.g. setting it to 10, will return 1/10 of the actual frequency counts. This way,
     * smaller n-gram models can be estimated.
     * 
     * The same functionality could be implemented in the components using the provider, but they
     * all needed to be aware of that down-scaling then which is undesirable. However, it might be
     * much faster, as the actual frequency count only needs to be retrieved once, and different
     * down-scaling factors can be tried instantly. So in some situations, it might be more
     * efficient to return the unscaled score and do it yourself.
     * 
     * Keep in mind that the resulting n-gram model is only a rough estimate of a really down-scaled
     * model. Especially normalizing with the number of n-grams will not give exact results, as some
     * of them now have zero counts and should not be counted. As long as one stays within the same
     * n-gram model, the effects should be relative and can be ignored. However, comparing the
     * relative frequencies from a down-scaled model with another model is invalid.
