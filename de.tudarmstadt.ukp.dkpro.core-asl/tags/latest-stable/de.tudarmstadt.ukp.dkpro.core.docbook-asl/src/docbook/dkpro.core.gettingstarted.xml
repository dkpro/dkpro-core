<chapter id="ugr.dkpro.core.gettingstarted">
  <title>Getting Started</title>
  <para>DKPro Core is a collection of software components for natural language processing (NLP) 
    based on the Apache UIMA framework.</para>
  <para>Many NLP tools are already freely available in the NLP research community. DKPro Core 
    provides UIMA components wrapping these tools (and some original tools) so they can be used 
    interchangeably in UIMA processing pipelines. DKPro Core builds heavily on uimaFIT which allows 
    for rapid and easy development of NLP processing pipelines, for wrapping existing tools and for 
    creating original UIMA components.</para>
