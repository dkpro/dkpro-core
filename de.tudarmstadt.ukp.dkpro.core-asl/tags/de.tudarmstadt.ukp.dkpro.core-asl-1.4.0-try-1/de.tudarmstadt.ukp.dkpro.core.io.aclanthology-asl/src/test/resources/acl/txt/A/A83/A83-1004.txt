 This paper describes a NL data base interface which consists oF two parts: a 
Natural Language Processor (NLP) and a data base application program (DBAP). The 
NLP is a general pur!~se language processor which builds a formal representation 
of the meaning of the English utterances it is given. The DBAP is an algorithm 
with builds a query in a augmented relational algebra from the output of the 
NLP. This approach yields an interface which is both extremely robust and 
portable.
 
where "colored", "'color" and "'house" are system primitives called concepts. 
Each concept is an extended case frame, [Fillmore 2]. The meaning of each 
concept to the system is implicit in its relation to the other system concepts 
and the way the system manipulates it. Each concept has case preferences 
associated with =IS cases. For example, the case preference of color is "color 
and the case preference of coloredis "physical-object. The case preferences 
induce a network among the concepts. For example, "color is connected to 
"physical-object via the path: ['physical-object colored'colored color "color]. 
In addition. "color is connected to "writing,implement, a refinement ot" 
"physicalobject, by a path whose meaning is that the writing implement writes 
with that color. This network is used by the NLP to determine the meaning of 
many modifications, For example, "red pencil" is either a pencil which is red or 
a pencil that writes red, depending on which path is chosen. In the absence of 
contextual information, the NLP chooses the shortest path. In normal usage, case 
preferences are often broken. The meaning of the broken preference involves 
coercing the offending concept to another one via a path in the network. 
Examples are: "Turn on the soup." "Turn on the burner that has soup on it." "My 
car will drink beer." "The passengers in my car will drink beer"
 
This paper describes an extremely robust and portable NL data base interface 
which consists of two parts: a Natural Language Processor (NLP) and a data base 
application program (DBAP). The NLP is a general purpose language processor 
which builds a formal representation of the meaning of the English utterances it 
is given. The DBAP is an algorithm with builds a query in an augmented 
relational algebra from the output of the NLP. The system is portable, or data 
base independent, because all that is needed to set up a new data base interface 
are definitions for concepts the NLP doesn't have, plus what I will call the 
+data base connection", i.e,, the connection between the relations in the data 
base and the NLP's concepts. Demonstrating the portability and the robustness 
gained from using a general purpose NLP are the main subjects of this paper 
Discussion of the NLP will be limited to its interaction with the DBAP and the 
data base connection, which by design, is minimal. [Ginsparg 5] contains a 
description of the NLP parsing algorithm.
 
3. The Data Base Connection 2. NLP overview
 The formal language the NLP uses to represent meaning is a variant of semantic 
nets [Quillian 8]. For example, the utterances "The color of the house is 
green," "The house's color is green." "Green ,~ the color that the house is." 
would all be ~ransformed to: Consider the data base given by the following 
scheme:
 
Parts(pno,pname,color.cosl,weight) Spj( sno,pno,jno.quantity ,m, y ) Suppliers 
and proiects have a number, )~ame and c~tV Parts ha'.,: a number, name, color, 
cost and weight Supplier wl(~,,unphe,, a quanntYof parts pno to prolect /no in 
month ,nor year
 The data base connection has four parts:
 
gl
 
Isa: "colored Tense: present Colored: g2 Color: g3 lsa: "house Definite: the 
Isa: "color Value: green
 
I. Connecting each relation to the appropriate concept: Suppliers - > "supplier
 
fi2. Connecting each attribute to the appropriate concept:
 
leg., Spj(sno,pno,jno,cost,quantity)) depended on the supplier
 
in which the cost ol a part
 
4. C r e a t i n g pseudo relations Pseudo Cities jcity,scity This creates a 
pseudo relation, Cities(cname), so that the query building algorithm can treat 
all attributes as if they belong to a relation. The query produced by the system 
will refer to the Cities relation. A postprocessor is used to remove references 
to pseudo relations from the final query. Pseudo relations are important because 
they ensure uniform handling of attributes. With the pseudo Cities relation, 
questions like "Who supplies every city? = and "List the cities." can be treated 
identically to "Who supplies every project'?" and "List the suppliers." The 
remainder of the data base connection is a set of switches which provide 
information on how to print out the relations. whether all proper nouns have 
been defined or are to be inferred. whether relations are multivalued, etc. The 
switch settings and the four components above constitute the entire data base 
connection, Nothing else iS needed. The network of concepts in the N L P should 
only be augmented for a particular data base; never changed. Yet different data 
base schemes will require different representations for the same word. For 
example, depending on the data base scheme, it could be correct to represent 
"box" as either, gl g2 g3 [sa: "part Conditions: "named(gl,box) Isa: "container 
Conditions: "named(g2.box) [sa: "box
 
3. Capturing the information implicit in each relation: 
Parts(pno,pname,color,cost,weight ) "indexnumberp i n d e x n u m b e r - > pno 
n u m b e r e d - > Parts "named n a m e - > pname n a m e d - > Parts "colored 
color - > color c o l o r e d - > Parts
 
costobj - > Parts "weighs w e i g h t - > weight w e i g h t o b j - > Parts 
Projects(jno.jnamedcity) "indexnumberp indexnumber - > jno n u m b e r e d - > 
Projects "named name - > jname n a m e d - > Projects "located location - > 
jetty located - > Prolects Suppliers(sno,sname,scity) "indexnumberp indexnumber 
- > sno n u m b e r e d - > Suppliers "named name - > sname n a m e d - > 
Suppliers "located location - > sctty located - > Suppliers %pl 
O~no.pno.lno.quant Hv.m.y ) "supply supplier - > '.;no supplied - > pno suppliee 
- > mo (cardinality-of pno) - > quantity u m e - > m.y "spend spender - > 1no s 
p e n d f o r -> pno amount (" cost quantity) The a m o u m case of "spend maps 
to a c o m p u t a t i o n rather than a ,~mgle a t t r i b u t e It' all the 
attributes in the c o m p u t a h o n are not present ,n the relation being 
defined, the query building program ioms ,n the necessary extra relations. So 
the definition of "spend ~mrks equally well irl tile example scheme as well as 
in a scheme 26
 
The solution is to define each word to map to the lowest possible concept. W h e 
n a concept is e n c o u n t e r e d that has a data base relation associated 
with )t. there is no problem. If there )s no relauon associated with a concept, 
the N L p searchs For a concept that d o e s correspond to a relation and is 
also a generalization ot" the concept in question. I f one is found, it is used 
with an appropriate condilion, usually "tilled or "named. So "box" has a 
definition which m a p s to "box. In the data base c o n n e c t i o n given 
above. "box" would be instantiated as a "=part" since " ' b o x " is a r e f i n 
e m e n t of "'part" and no relation maps to "box,"
 
Using the Connection
 
The information in the data base connection ts primarily used m building the 
query (section .~). But It IS ~llso used Io augment the knowledge base of Ihe N 
L P The data base connection is used to overwrite the NLP's ca~e preferences. 
Since I o c a w d - > S u p p h e r s ()r Projects. the preference ot" localed 
ts spec)fied to "suppliers or "protects. This enables the NLP to interpret the 
first noun group )n "Do ,m', suppliers that supply widgets located nl london 
also supply ,~cre',vs )" as "'suppliers in London that supply widgets" rather 
than "supphers that ,;upph London wldgets" This )s in contrast to [Gawron 31 
which u'..;es ,i separate "disambiguator" phase to ehmlnale parses that do 11()i 
make sense =n the conceptual scheme of the dala base. Tile additional preference 
informamm supplied bv the data base connection is used to induce coercions 
(section 2.) thai would rlot be made in the absence of the connection (~r under 
,mother data
 
fibase scheme. "Who supplies London" does not break any real world preferences, 
but does break one of the preferences induced by this data base scheme, namely 
that Suppliee is a "project. London. a "city, is coerced to "project via the 
path [*project located *located /ocanon 캽ityl and the question is understood to 
mean "Who supplies projects which are in London." As mentioned in Section 2., 
the NLP determines the meanin~ of many modifications by searching for 
connections in a semantic net. The data base connection is used to augment and 
highlight the existing network of the NLP. I f the user says, "What colors do 
parts come in?', the NLP can infer that the meaning of "come-in" intended by the 
user is "colored since the only path through the net between "color and "part 
derived from the case preferences induced by the data base connection is ['part 
colored "colored color "color] Similarly, when given the noun group "London 
suppliers" the meaning is determined by tracing the shortest path through the 
highlighted net, ['supplier located'located Iocanon "city] The longer path 
connecting "supplier and "city, ['supplier supplier "supply suppliee *project 
located "location location *city] which means "the suppliers that supply to 
london projects" is found when the NLP rejects the first meaning because of 
context, If the user says "What are the locations of the London suppliers" the 
system assumes the second meaning since the first (in the domain of this data 
base scheme) leads to a tautological reading. The NLP is able to infer that "The 
locations of the suppliers located in London" is tautological while "The 
locations of the suppliers located in England" is not, because the data base 
connection has specified "located to be a single valued concept with its 
Iocarton case typed to "city. I f the system were asked for the locations of 
suppliers in England, and it knew England was a country, the question would be 
interpreted as "the cities of the suppliers that are located in cities located 
in England."
 
The NLP treats most true-l'aise questions with indefinites as requests for the 
data which would make the statement true. The question's meaning is "to show the 
subset of london proiects that are supplied by Blake." The query building 
algorithm builds up the query recursively Given an instantiated concept with 
cases, =t expands the contents of each case and links the results together with 
the relation corresponding to the concept. Given an instantiated concept with 
conditions, it expands each condition. For the example, we have.
 
Expand gl Expand g2, the Element of gl
 Expand gg, the Condition of g2.
 Expand g3, the Supplier case of gg. Expand g9, the Condition of g3. From the 
data base connection, a "named whose named case is a *supplier is realized by 
the Suppliers relation using the sname attribute So we have, g9 - select tram 
Suppliers where sname -- blake From the data base connection, a "supply is 
realized by the Spj relation. This results in, gga -- project]no/i'om.joinSpj to 
g9
 
g8 -- joingga toProjects g8 is the projects supplied by Blake.
 Expand 84, the set gl is a subset of, by expanding its element. g6 Expand glO. 
the Condition of gb Expand g7, the location case of glO yielding g l l -- select 
#am Cities wherecname - london
 
A "located with a "project in the Iocotedcase ~s realized by the Projects 
relation using the ]city attribute. So we have. glOa -- join Projects Io gl I 
where]city = cname glOb - proiect ]no /'romglOa glO - ]oinglOb toProjects g[0 is 
the projects in London.
 Intersect the expansions of g2 and g4 and project the prolect names. gl3 = 
pro/eel]name lrom imersectton g 8 glO
 
5. A trtee of the query building algorithm.
 The query budding algorithm is illustrated by tracmg its operation on the 
question, "Does blake supply any prolects in london'?"
 
The entire query is,
 
The NLP's meaning representation I'or this question ts shown below. gO Isa: 
"show g5 Isa: "name Value: blake g9 Isa: "named Tense: present Named: g3 Name: 
g5 Isa: "tocated Tense: present Located: gb Location: g7 Isa: "named Tense: 
present Named: g7 Name: g12 Isa: *name Value: london
 
Tense: present Toshow: g l gO
 
[sa: "set Element: 2 Subset-of': g4 Isa: "protect
 
Isa: "project Element-of: g4 Conditions: glO glO lsa: city Conditions: gll Isa: 
"supply Tense: Present Suppler: g3 Suppliee: g2 gl [
 
g9 = select/romSuppliers where s n a m e = blake g8a -- /~'oiecrjno #om ioin Spj 
to g9 g8 = loin gga to Projects gl0 = select #am Projects where icily = london g 
13 -- prelect iname lrom mter'~e('tlo~t g8 g I0 where the: extra loin resulting 
f'rom the pseudo (:h=e~ relation ha', been rernoved by the post processor 
(section 3 ) Entirely as a side effe,'t of the way the query rs generated, the 
-,,,,,tern can easily correct any l'alse assumptions made by the u~,,2r [Kaplan 
71. For example, if there were no projects in London. gill would be empty and 
system would respond, generating Irom the instantiated concept glO li.e., the 
names used in query correspond to the names used in the knowledge representatmnL 
"There arc no suppliers located in London." No additional "'.=oiated 
presupposition" mechanism is requ+red.
 
The remainder of this section discusses several aspects o the query building 
process that the trace does not show. Negations are handled by introducing a set 
difference when necessary If the example query were "Does Blake supply any 
projects that aren't in London?", the expansion of g7 would have been.
 
I f we ask. "Who frequents a bar that serves a beer John likes?". we get the 
following query. 81 82 g3 84 85 =" select from Likes where drinker - john - 
project beer l'rom g 1 - .join Serves to 82 =" project bar I~om g3 "" join 
Frequents to 84
 
Expand g7. the location case of glO yielding g i l a - select [romCities 
wherecname -- london gl 1 - difference o f Cities a n d g l la
 Conjunctions are handled by introducing an an intersection or union. I f the 
example query were "Does Blake supply any projects in London or Paris'?', the 
/ocanon case of g10 would have. been the conjunction 813.
 
I f we ask "Who frequents a bar that serves a beer that he likes?" the correct 
query, is.
 
isa "conjunction Type: or Conjoins: g7 g14 [sa: "city Conditions: g l 5 lsa: 
"named Named: g15 Name: g l 6 Isa: "name Value: paris
 
glb
 
In the first query "beer" was the only attribute projected from g l [n the 
second, the system projected both "beer" and "drinker", because in expanding "a 
beer he likes" it needed to expand an instantiated concept (the one representing 
"who") that was already being expanded. All of these cases interact gracefully 
with one another. For example. there is no problem in handling "Who supplies 
every project that is not supplied by blake and bowles".
 
The result of expanding gl3 would be,
 
[n general, "or" becomes a union and "and" becomes an intersection. However, if 
an "and" conjunction is in a single valued case (information obtained from the 
data base connection), a union is used instead. Thus "Who supplies london and 
paris?" is interpreted as "Who supplies both London and Paris'?" and "Who is in 
London and Pans?" is interpreted as "Who is in London and who ~s m Paris?" )n 
the example data base scheme.
 
6. Advantages of this approach
 The system can understand anything it has a concept about. regardless o f 
whether the concept is attached to a relation in the data base scheme. In the 
Suppliers data base from Secuon 4., parts had costs and weights associated with 
them, but not sizes. I f a user asks "How big are each of the parts?" and the 
interface has a "size primitive (which it does), the query building process wdl 
attempt to find the relation which "size maps to and on fading wdl report back 
to the user. "There is no information in the data base about the size of the 
parts." This gives the user some informatmn about the what the data base 
contains, An answer like "1 don't know what "big" means." would leave the user 
wondering whether size information was in the data base and obtainable if only 
the "right" word was used. The system can interpret user statements that are not 
queries. If the user says "A big supplier is a supplier that supplies more than 
3 projects" the NLP can use, the definition qn answering later queries. The 
definition is not made on a "string" basis e.g., substttuting the words of one 
side of the definition for the other Instead. whenever the query building 
algorithm encounters an mstantiated concept that is a supplier wnh the condition 
"size~x. big) it builds a query substnuting the condiuon from the definition 
that it can expand as a data base query Thus the .~vstern can handle "big london 
suppliers" and answer "Which sunpliers are big" which it couldn't if ~t were 
doing strlct string substitution. This Facility can be used to bootstrap common 
definitions In ,~ commercial flights application, with data base scheme, 
Flights(fl#,carrier,from.to,departure,arrival.stops.cost ) the word "nonstop" is 
defined to the system in English as, "A nonstop flight is a night that does not 
make any stops " and then saved along wuh the rest of the system's defimt~ons. 
28
 
Quantifiers are handled by a post processing phase. "Does blake supply every 
project in London?" is handled identically to "Does Blake supply a prolect in 
London'?" except that the expansion of "projects m London" is marked so that the 
post processor will be called. The post processor adds on a set of commands 
which check that the set difference of London projects and London prolects that 
Blake supplies is empty. The rasulhn 8 query is. gl = =_2 g3 = g4 = =_5 = gO = 
g7 = g8 = ~e/ect lrom Suppliers w/weresname = blake ~elect l m m Projects where 
jcity - london /otnSpl togl tomg3 to g2 protect jno from g2 protect ino /tom g4 
{hl]~'rem'e org5 andgO empn, g7
 
] h e first tour commands are the query for "Does Blake supply a llrolect m 
London'?". The last tour check that no project in London is not supplied by 
Blake. -\ minor modification is needed to cover cases in which the query 
building algorithm is expanding an instantiated concept that refercnces an 
instuntiated concept that is being expanded in a higher recursmve call The 
following examples illustrate this. Consider the data base scheme below, taken 
from [Ullman ql.
 
Coercions (section 2.) can be used solve problems that may require inferences in 
other systems. [Grosz 6] discusses the query "Is there a doctor within 200 miles 
of Philadelphia" in the context of a scheme in which doctors are on ships and 
ships have distances from cities, and asserts that a system which handles this 
query must be able to inter that if a doctor is on a ship, and the ship is with 
200 miles of Philadelphia, then the doctor is within 200 miles of Philadelphia. 
Using coercions, the query would be understood as "is there a ship with a doctor 
on it that is within 200 miles of Philadelphia?', which solves the problem 
immediately. Since the preference information is only used to choose among 
competing interpretations, broken preferences can still be understood and 
responded to. The preference for the supplier case is specified to 톝upplier but 
if the user says "How many parts does the sorter project supply?" the NLP will 
find the only interpretation and respond "projects do not supply parts, 
suppliers do." Ambiguities inherent in attribute values are handled using the 
same methods which handles words with multiple definitions. For example, 1980 
may be an organization number, a telephone extension, a number, or a year. The 
NLP has a rudimentary (so far) expert system inference mechanism which can 
easily be used by the DBAP. One of the rules it uses is "If x is a precondition 
of y and z knows y is true then z knows x was and may still be true" One of the 
['acts in the NLP knowledge base is that being married is a precondition of 
being divorced or widowed. I f a user asks "Did Fred Smith used to be married?" 
in a data base with the relation Employees(name, marital-status) the system can 
answer correctly by using its inference mechanism. The exact method is as 
follows. The data base application receives the true-false question: "Fred Smith 
was married and Fred Smith is no longer married"
 
The system handles all the examples in this paper as well as a wide range of 
others (Appendix A.). Several different data bases schemes have been connected 
to the system for demonstrations, including one "real data base" abstracted from 
the on-line listing of the Bell Laboratories Company Directory.
 
9. Since the data base includes only current marital status information. the 
only way to answer the first part of the question is to inl'cr it from some 
other information in the data base. The data base application sends the query to 
the NLP inference mechanism which would ordinarily attempt to answer it by 
matching it against its knowledge base or by finding a theorem which would gives 
it something else to match ['or When called by the data base application, the 
inference mechanism simply uses its rules base to decide what it should match 
['or, and then returns to the data base program. In this, example, the inference 
mechanism receives "Fred Smith was married" and using the precondition rule 
mentioned above, returns to the data base program, "Is Fred Smith divorced" or 
"is Fred Smith widowed", which can be answered by the data base. The DBAP can 
call the inference mechanism recursively if necessary.
