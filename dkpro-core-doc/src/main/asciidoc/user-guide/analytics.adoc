== Segmentation

=== Tokenization and sentence boundary detection

Tokenization and sentence boundary detection are usually realized in one segmenter component in 
DKPro Core. The reason is that in some cases, a segmenter needs to run before a tokenizer and in
other cases it is the other way around. By running always both steps in a single component, the
user does not have to worry about the order in which the steps are run internally. However, it is
still possible to configure segmenters such that they produce either only tokens or sentence
annotations.

DKPro Core assumes that tokens are non-overlapping. Many components additionally assume that
tokens are located inside sentences and that they do not extend beyond the sentence bounaries.

=== Normalizing tokens

Some tokenizers apply a basic normalization of the token text. UIMA does not allow changing the
document text. Thus, the `Token` annotation has a feature called  `form` which can be used to store
the normalized form of the token text. The method `setText` should be used to set the form of a
token. It internally determines whether a `TokenForm` annotation is necessary (i.e. whether the
form differs from the covered text of the token) or not. Likewise, the method `getText` should be
used to retrieve the token text that should be used for further analysis. The method `getText`
should not be used be writers - they should write the original document text (i.e. `getCoveredText`)
unless there is a special field in the output for normalized token text.

=== Headings

Headings typically do not end with a sentence end marker (i.e. a full stop `.`). As a consequence
segmenters are confused and consider a heading and the first sentence of the following paragraph
to be a single sentence unit. This can be resolved by adding <<typesystem-reference.adoc#type-de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.api.segmentation.type.Div,Div>> annotations to the document
(and its subtypes) and configuring segmenters to respect these. Such annotations can be obtained
for example by using:

* a reader component that creates Paragraph and Heading annotations (e.g. the <<format-reference.adoc#format-Pdf, PdfReader>>)
* an analysis component that detects Paragraph boundaries (e.g. the <<component-reference.adoc#engine-ParagraphSplitter,ParagraphSplitter>>)

Segmenters are by default configured to respect Div-type annotations (the default value for
`PARAM_ZONE_TYPES` is <<typesystem-reference.adoc#type-de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.api.segmentation.type.Div,Div>>). 
This means,  segmenters will ensure that sentences and tokens to not overlap with their boundaries. 
If desired, `PARAM_STRICT_ZONING` can be set to `true` (default `false`) to ensure that tokens and
sentences are only created within the boundaries of the zone types.

=== Hyphenation

Hyphenated words cannot be properly processed by NLP tools. The 
<<component-reference.adoc#engine-HyphenationRemover,HyphenationRemover>> component can be used
to join hypenated words.


////
EJ: This section would be more helpful if, instead of telling what not to do ('Don't ask
us what components to use!'), it provided guidelines on what __to__ do.  
////

To begin selecting tools to use in your pipeline, you may wish to use the same tools you 
were running on your data before switching to uimaFIT, or use the same tool specifications 
as others working on the your NLP task.  With DKPro Core, it is easy to import the exact 
tool version and model version you need to replicate the work of others.  Or, you may 
wish to conduct a comparison of multiple tools with the same function, to see which 
performs best on your data.  With DKPro Core, it is simple to switch between multiple
tools with the same function, or multiple models for a tool.

Because DKPro Core does not alter any of the integrated tools, however, it is up to the 
user to make sure that sequential components or models use matching tokenizations or 
tagsets, and that the component or model is appropriate for the user's data (i.e., 
a pos-tagger for newstext may perform badly if applied to Twitter data).

////
Sometimes we get asked which parser, tagger, etc. is the best and which should be
used. We currently do not make any evaluations of the integrated tools. Also, building a
pipeline just of the "best" components may not actually yield the best results, because
of several reasons:

* components or models may expect different tokenizations or tagsets
* components or models may be good for one domain (e.g. news) but not for
  another (e.g. twitter data)

We recommend that you try various combinations and stick with the one that gives the
best result for __your__ data.

== Lemmatizaton

=== Lemmatizing multiwords

If you use lemma information in your pipeline, you should bear in mind that
multiword expressions, in particular discontinuous multiwords, might not be
lemmatized as one word (or expression), but rather each multiword part might be
lemmatized separately. In languages such as German, there are verbs with
separable particle such as _anfangen_ (_an_ occurs separate from _fangen_ in
particular sentence constructions). Therefore - depending on your use case - you
might consider postprocessing the output of the lemmatizer in order to get the
true lemmas (which you might need, e.g. in order to look up information in a
lexical resource).

== Dictionaries and other lexical resources

If you use components in your pipeline that access dictionaries or other
lexical resources, it might be essential to include a Lemmatizer in your
pipeline: Many dictionaries and well-known lexical resources such as WordNet
require at minimum a lemma form as a search word in order to return information
about that word. For large-scale lexical resources, e.g. for Wiktionary,
additional information about POS is very helpful in order to reduce the
ambiguity of a given lemma form.

== Compatibility of Components

When selecting components for your pipeline you should make sure that the
components are compatible regarding the annotation types they expect or
offer.


* if a component expects an annotation type that is not provided by the
  preceding component, that may lead to an error or simply to no
  results
* if a component (e.g. a reader which adds sentence annotations) provides an
  annotation that is added again by a subsequent component (e.g. a segmenter),
  that will result in undefined behaviour of other components when you iterate
  over the annotation that has been added more than once.

To check whether components are compatible, you can look at the
++@TypeCapability++ annotation which is available in most DKPro
Core components. Mind that many components can be configured with regards to which
types they consume or produce, so the ++@TypeCapability++ should be
taken as a rough indicator, not as a definitive information. It is also important to
note, that the ++@TypeCapability++ does say anything about the tagset
being consumed or produced by a component. E.g. one if a POS-tagger uses a model
that produces POS-tags from the tagset X and a dependency-parser uses a model that
requires POS-tags from the tagset Y, then the two models are not semantically
compatible - even though the POS-tagger and dependency-parser components are
compatible on the level of the type system.

=== Morphologically Rich Languages

////
EJ: What's the goal of this subsection?  Other sister sections have advice
for how to construct a different pipeline, but this section just says,
'Your individual tools might not work well.'
////

* Parsing: Morphologically rich languages (e.g. Czech, German, and
  Hungarian) pose a particular challenge to parser components (Tsarfaty et
  al. 2013).


* Morphological analysis: for languages with case syncretism (displaying
  forms that are ambiguous regarding their case, e.g. _Frauen_ in German
  can be nominative or genitive or dative or accusative), it might be
  better to leave case underspecified at the morphosyntactic level and
  leave disambiguation to the components at the syntactic level. Otherwise
  errors might be introduced that will then be propagated to the next
  pipeline component (Seeker and Kuhn 2013).


=== Domain-specific and other non-standard data

Most components (sentence splitters, POS taggers, parsers ...) are trained on
(standard) newspaper text. As a consequence, you might encounter a significant
performance drop if you apply the components to domain specific or other
non-standard data (scientific abstracts, Twitter data, etc.) without adaptation.

* Tokenizing: adapting the tokenizer to your specific domain is crucial,
  since tokenizer errors propagate to all subsequent components in the
  pipeline and worsen their performance. For example, you might adapt your
  tokenizer to become aware of emoticons or chemical formulae in order to
  process social media data or text from the biochemical domain.
  
////
  EJ: Ok, I want to adapt my tokenizer.  How do I do this/ what's the next step?
  Please give pointers.
////


=== Shallow processing and POS tagsets

While more advanced semantic processing (e.g. discourse analysis) typically
depends on the output of a parser component, there might be settings where you
prefer to perform shallow processing (i.e. POS tagging and chunking).

For shallow processing, it might be necessary to become familiar with the
original POS tagsets of the POS taggers rather than relying on the uniform, but
coarse-grained DKPro Core POS tags (because the original fine-grained POS tags
carry more information).

Although many POS taggers in a given language are trained on the same POS
tagset (e.g. the Penn TreeBank Tagset for English, the STTS Tagset for German),
the individual POS Taggers might output variants of this tagset. You should be
aware of the fact that in the DKPro Core version of the tagger, the original POS
tagger output possibly has been mapped to a version that is compatible with the
corresponding original tagset. (Example)

////
EJ: Ok, I want to switch to the original POS tagset.  How do I do this?  Pointers?
////

== Adding components as dependencies (Maven)

In order to start using an integrated tool from DKPro Core, we can add it as a
Maven dependency to our experiment.

As an example, we take the OpenNlpPosTagger component. To make it available in a
pipeline, we add the following dependency to our POM file:


[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<properties>
  <dkpro.core.version>{revnumber}</dkpro.core.version>
</properties>
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core</groupId>
      <artifactId>de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core-asl</artifactId>
      <version>${dkpro.core.version}</version>
      <type>pom</type>
      <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>

<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.opennlp-asl</artifactId>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

The dependency on DKPro Core declared in the dependency management section fixes the
version of all DKPro Core dependencies that are added to the POM. Hence, it is not
necessary to declare the version for each dependency. When upgrading to a new DKPro Core
version, it is sufficient to change the value of the
++dkpro.core.version++ property in the properties section.

NOTE: If you use a multi-module project, the `properties` and `dependencyManagement` sections should
      go into the parent-pom of your project, while the `dependencies` section should be added to
      the respective module requiring the dependency.

NOTE: If you want to use GPLed components, you have to add an additional dependency declaration
      in the dependency management section referring to the `de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core-gpl`
      artifact.

== Adding resources as dependencies (Maven)

Most components (i.e., tools such as OpenNlpPosTagger) require resources such as models 
(such as opennlp-model-tagger-en-maxent) in order to operate. Since components
and resources are versioned separately, it can be non-trivial to find the right version
of a resource for a particular version of a component. For this reason, DKPro Core
components each maintain a list of resources known to be compatible with them. This
information can be accessed in a Maven POM, thus avoiding the need to manually specify
the version of the models. Consequently, when you upgrade to a new version of DKPro
Core, all models are automatically upgraded as well. This is usually the desired
solution, although it can mean that your pipelines may produce slightly different
results.

As an example, we take the OpenNlpPosTagger component. In the previous section, we
have seen how to make it available in a pipeline. Now we also add the model for
English.

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.opennlp-model-tagger-en-maxent</artifactId>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core</groupId>
      <artifactId>de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.opennlp-asl</artifactId>
      <version>${dkpro.core.version}</version>
      <type>pom</type>
      <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

The dependency on the DKPro Core OpenNLP module declared in the dependency management
section fixes the version of all known OpenNLP models. Thus, it is not necessary to
declare a version on each model dependency. When upgrading to a new DKPro Core version,
it is sufficient to change the value of the ++dkpro.core.version++
property in the properties section.

Models are presently maintained in a separate repository that needs to be explicitly added to your
POM:
