= Setup

This section explains the setup for developers. Please also refer to the **Setup** section in the
User's Guide as it may contain additional information necessary to run DKPro Core components
(e.g. special libraries that need to be installed depending on your operating system).

== GIT

All DKPro Core files are stored using UNIX line endings. If you develop on Windows, you have to
set the `core.autocrlf` configuration setting to `input` to avoid accidentally submitting Windows
line endings to the repository. Using `input` is a good strategy in most cases, thus you should
consider setting this as a global (add `--global`) or even as a system (`--system`) setting.

.Configure git line ending treatment
[source,text]
----
C:\> git config --global core.autocrlf input
----

After changing this setting, best do a fresh clone and check-out of DKPro Core.

== Eclipse

=== Use a JDK

On Linux or OS X, the following setting is not necessary. Having a full JDK installed on your
system is generally sufficient. You can skip on to the next section.

On Windows, you need to edit the `eclipse.ini` file and directly before the `-vmargs` line, you
have to add the following two lines. Mind to replace `C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.8.0_144` with the actual
location of the JDK on your system. Without this, Eclipse will complain that the 
`jdk.tools:jdk.tools` artifact would be missing.

.Force Eclipse to run on a JDK
[source,text]
----
-vm
C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.8.0_144/jre/bin/server/jvm.dll
----

=== Required Plugins

* *Maven Integration:* m2e , already comes pre-installed with the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers.
  If you use another edition of Eclipse which does not have m2e pre-installed, go to 
  *Help->Install New Software*, select *--All available sites--* and choose 
  *Collaboration -> m2e - Maven Integration for Eclipse*
* *Apache UIMA tools:* Update site: `http://www.apache.org/dist/uima/eclipse-update-site/`
* *Groovy:* Find the applicable update site here: `https://github.com/groovy/groovy-eclipse/wiki`
** Make sure to install at least the Groovy Eclipse Feature, the Groovy Compiler (2.4), and the
   Groovy M2E Integration.
* *Checkstyle Eclipse plugin:* Update site: `http://eclipse-cs.sf.net/update`
* *Checkstyle configuration plugin for M2Eclipse:* Update site: 
  `http://m2e-code-quality.github.com/m2e-code-quality/site/latest/`

=== Workspace Preferences

The following settings are recommended for the *Eclipse Workspace Preferences*:

[options="header"]
|====
|Setting|Value

| General -> Workspace -> Text file encoding 
| UTF-8

| General -> Workspace -> New text file line delimiter
| Unix

| General -> Editors -> Text Editors -> Displayed tab width
| 2

| General -> Editors -> Text Editors -> Insert spaces for tabs
| true

| General -> Editors -> Text Editors -> Show print margin
| true

|====

=== Import

In Eclipse, go to *File -> Import*, choose *Existing Maven projects*, and select the folder to
which you have cloned DKPro Core. Eclipse should automatically detect all modules. Mind that
DKPro Core is a large project and it takes significant time until all dependencies have been 
downloaded and until the first build is complete.
