= Adding Modules

DKPro Core consists of a number of Maven modules. The actual components (readers, writers) as
well as the DKPro Core types and APIs reside within these modules. 

== Module Naming Scheme

The name is the first thing to consider when creating a new module.

Although the modules are technically all the same, in the naming scheme, we discern between the
following types of modules:

* API modules (`dkpro-core-api-NAME-asl`) - these modules contain common base classes, utility
  classes, type system definitions and JCas classes. Since API modules are used in many places,
  they must be licensed under the Apache License.
* IO modules (`dkpro-core-io-NAME-LIC`) - these modules contain reader and writer components. They
  are usually named after the file format (e.g. `lif`) or family of file formats they support
  (e.g. `conll`).
* FS modules (`dkpro-core-fs-NAME-LIC`) - these modules contain support for specific file systems.
  They are usually named after the file system type they support (e.g. `hdfs`).
* Component modules (`dkpro-core-NAME-LIC`) - these modules contain processing components. 
  They are usually named after the tool or library that is wrapped (e.g. `treetagger` or `corenlp`).

In addition to the four categories, there are a view unique modules which do not fall into any
of these categories, e.g. `de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.testing-asl` or 
`de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.doc-asl`.

NOTE: DKPro Core is in a transition phase from the traditional but deprecated naming scheme
      (`de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core...`) to the new naming scheme (`org.dkpro.core...`). Many modules
      still make use of the old naming scheme.

The naming scheme applies in several occasions:

* module folder - the sub-folder within the DKPro Core project which contains the module
* artifactId - the Maven artifactId as recorded in the `pom.xml` file. The groupId should always
  be `org.dkpro.core`.
* Java packages - the module name translates roughly into the Java package names, e.g. the root
  Java package in the module `dkpro-core-io-lif-asl` is `org.dkpro.core.io.lif`. 

== Module Hierarchy

Once you have decided on a name for the new module, you proceed by creating a new module folder.
Module folders are created directly under the root of the DKPro Core source tree.

Although the folder structure of DKPro Core appears as if there would be a flat list of modules,
there is actually a shallow hierarchy of modules (i.e. the folder hierarchy does not correspond
to the Maven module hierarchy).

The *DKPro Core Parent POM* is at the root of the module and of the folder hierarchy. Its parent
is the *DKPro Parent POM* which is maintained in a separate source tree and which follows its own
release cycle. The *DKPro Parent POM* defines a set of default settings, profiles, and managed
dependencies useful for all DKPro projects. The *DKPro Core Parent POM* defines settings specific
to DKPro Core.

```
DKPro Parent POM
  DKPro Core Parent POM
    DKPro Core ASL Parent POM
      ... DKPro Core ASL modules ...
    DKPro Core GPL Parent POM
      ... DKPro Core GPL modules ...
    DKPro Core Documentation
```

New modules are added either in the `<modules>` section of the *DKPro Core ASL Parent POM* or of the
*DKPro Core GPL Parent POM* depending on whether the new module can be licensed under the Apache License
or whether it has to be licensed under the GPL due to a GPL dependency. The these two parent POMs
configure different sets of license checkers. For ASL modules, the link:http://creadur.apache.org/rat/apache-rat-plugin/[Apache RAT Maven Plugin] is used; for the GPL modules, the link:http://code.mycila.com/license-maven-plugin/[License Maven Plugin] is used.

Note that the `<modules>` section in these POMs points to the folders which contain the respective
modules. Since the folder hierarchy is flat (unlike the module hierarchy), the module names here
need to be prefixed with `../`.

    <!-- API modules -->
    <module>../dkpro-core-api-anomaly-asl</module>
    <module>../dkpro-core-api-coref-asl</module>
    ...
    <!-- FS modules -->
    <module>../dkpro-core-fs-hdfs-asl</module>

    <module>../dkpro-core-castransformation-asl</module>
    <module>../dkpro-core-cisstem-asl</module>
    ...
  </modules>
----

In addition to adding a new module to the `<modules>` section of the respective parent POM, it 
also needs to be added to the `<dependencyManagement>` section with this POM:

.Excerpt from the DKPro Core ASL Parent POM dependency management section
[source,xml,indent=0,subs="+attributes"]
----
  <dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.dkpro.core</groupId>
        <artifactId>dkpro-core-foo-asl</artifactId>
        <version>{revnumber}</version>
      </dependency>
      ...
    </dependencies>
  </dependencyManagement>
----

NOTE: If you create a GPLed module, copy the `.license-header.txt` file from another GPLed module
      to your new module in order to properly configure the license checker. Mind that the GPL license
      text in XML files must be indented by *4 spaces* and will not be recognized otherwise. You may
      have to adjust the text, depending on whether the module can be licensed under GPLv3 or has to
      be licensed under GPLv2.

NOTE: If not all of the dependencies of your new module are available from Maven Central or
      JCenter, then add the module within the `<modules>` and `<dependencyManagemen>` sections located
      under the `deps-not-on-maven-central` profile within the respective parent POM. Also add the
      required third-party repositories there if necessary.

== Basic POM

Next, you create a basic POM inside your new module folder. Below is an example of a minimal
POM for a new Apache-licensed component module. If you create a GPL-licensed module instead,
replace the `-asl` suffixes with `-gpl` and copy the license header from another GPLed module.

== Library Dependencies

In order to avoid unpleasant surprises, DKPro Core uses the Maven Dependency Plugin to check if
all dependencies used directly within the code of a module are also explicitly declared in the
module POM. If this is not the case, the automated builds fail (they run with `-DfailOnWarning`).
This means, you have to declare dependencies for all libraries that you are using directly 
from your code in the `<dependencies>` section. If a dependency is only required during testing,
it must be marked with `<scope>test</scope>`. Below, you find a few typical libraries used in many
modules. Note that there is no version defined for these dependencies. The versions for many
libraries used by multiple modules in DKPro Core are defined in the *DKPro Core Parent POM*.
Only libraries that are specific to a particular module, e.g. the specific NLP library wrapped,
should have their versions defined within the module POM.

You may notice the `foo.version` property in the minimal POM example above. This property should
be used to set the version of wrapped NLP library. It should appear in the name of the module
as well as in the specific dependency for the wrapped library.

      <version>${foo.version}</version>
    </dependency>

== Model Dependencies

When you package models for your new component, they need a special treatment in the POM. First, 
although it is a good idea to create unit tests based on the models, most often you do not want
to download all models and run all unit tests during a normal developer build (some models are
very large any may quickly fill up your hard disk). Second, the Maven Dependency Plugin is unable
to detect that your code or tests make use of the models and it needs to be configured in a 
special way to allow the build to pass even though it considers the model dependencies as
unnecessary.

So assuming you have a model for your component, then first add it to the `<dependencyManagemen>`
section of the POM - here you specify the version but not the scope. All models you have get
added to this section, irrespective of whether you want to use them for testing or not.

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="+attributes"]
----
  <dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
      <dependency>
        <groupId>de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core</groupId>

        <version>20120616.1</version>
      </dependency>
    </dependencies>
  </dependencyManagement>      
----

If you also want to use the model for testing, then you add it also to the `<dependencies>` section
of the POM. Here you specify the scope but not the version. Then you also have to configure the
Maven Dependency Plugin to accept the presence of the dependency.

----

      <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
  <dependencies>    
  <build>
    <pluginManagement>
      <plugins>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
          <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>
          <configuration>
            <usedDependencies>
              <!-- Models not detected by byte-code analysis -->
              <usedDependency>de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core:de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.opennlp-model-tagger-en-maxent</usedDependency>
            </usedDependencies>
          </configuration>
        </plugin>
      </plugins>
    </pluginManagement>
  </build>
----

As said before, if you have many models for your component, it is a good idea to use only a small
set for regular testing. If you want to create tests for additional models or even for all of
your models, then it is best to add the dependencies for these under a profile called `use-full-resources`.
This profile is enabled for automated builds or can be enabled on demand by developers who wish
to run all tests. In the example below, we add an additional test dependency on a German model
if the profile `use-full-resources` is enabled. Note that the Maven Dependency Plugin is also again
configured within the profile and that the `combine.children="append"` parameter is used to merge
the configuration with the one already present for the default build.

  <profiles>

----

To conditionally run a test only if the required model is enabled, you can use the `AssumeResource`
class from the DKPro Core testing module.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
AssumeResource.assumeResource(OpenNlpPosTagger.class, "tagger", language, variant);
----

== LICENSE.txt

Every module must contain a file called `LICENSE.txt` at its root which contains the license text.
Copy this file from another Apache-licensed or GPL-licensed module (again check if you need to
use GPLv2 or v3). If this file is not present, the build will fail.

== NOTICE.txt

If the module contains code or resources from a third party (e.g. a source or test file which you
copied from some other code repository or obtained from some website), then you need to add a
file called `NOTICE.txt` next to the `LICENSE.txt` file. For every third-party file (or set of files
if mutiple files were obtained from the same source under the same conditions), the `NOTICE.txt`
must contain a statement which allows to identify the files, identify from where these files were
obtained, and contain a copyright and license statement. Check the license of the original files
for whether you have to include the full license text and potentially some specific attribution
(possibly from an upstream `NOTICE` file).
