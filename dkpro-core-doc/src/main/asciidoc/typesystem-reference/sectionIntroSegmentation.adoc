.Segmentation types

The segmentation type system consists of two primary areas: tokenization (including sentences),
compound words, and document structure.

The *Sentence* annotation type is simply a span with no futher attributes.

The *Token* type may be explicitly linked to a part of speech, lemma, and stem. It is expected that
if either of these annotations are present, the token explicitly refers to them. If more than one
annotation of such a type, e.g. multiple part-of-speech annotations are present, then it is expected
that the token links to the most probable one, while the others are only located at the same offsets.

Additionally, the *Token* can link into the syntactic constituency structure via the *parent* feature.

The document structure can be encoded using the *Div* types. The type *Div* itself is a generic type
representing some element of the document structure more closely specified by the *divType* attribute.
The value of *divType* corresponds to the tag used in some original document format or to the output
of a text segmentation tool. E.g. when reading an HTML document, the *divType* for a paragraph would
be *p*, whereas in a DocBook XML file, it would instead be *para*.

For typical structural elements, the subtypes *Document*, *Heading*, and *Paragrah* are available.
*Document* is rarely used, since the basic assumption is that a CAS always represents a document.
