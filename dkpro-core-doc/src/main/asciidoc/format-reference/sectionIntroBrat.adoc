This format is the native format of the link:https://brat.nlplab.org[brat rapid annotation tool]. 
Its official documentation can be found link:https://brat.nlplab.org/standoff.html[here].

In general, the format consists of two files for each document:

* an `.ann` file containing the annotations. These are the files you need to point the 
  `PARAM_SOURCE_LOCATION` parameter of the `BratReader` to.
* a plain text file (`.txt`) containing the document text in UTF-8. These files need to be next to
  the corresponding `.ann` files and have the same name, just with the `.txt` extension instead of
  `.ann` extension.

The brat format supports different types of annotations which start with different letters in the
`.ann` file:

.brat annotation types
|====
| Type | Letter | Comment

| Text annotations
| `T`
|

| Event annotations
| `E`
|

| Relation annotations
| `R`
|

| Note annotations
| `#`
|

| Normalization annotations
| `N`
| currently not supported by DKPro Core
|====

.Attributes
Additionally, attributes (`A`) can be attached to annotations. Note that DKPro Core supports
attributes on relations, but the brat tool itself can only deal with attributes on text annotations
and events. The `BratReader` will try to store the values of attributes in correspondingly named
features on the target UIMA types.

.Reading the brat format
The DKPro Core `BratReader` tries its best to map a given brat file into the UIMA type system of the
CAS it is given. Thus, the `BratReader` is not bound strictly to the pre-defined DKPro Core types,
but supports any custom types as well. Since the type names in UIMA are typically long (e.g.
`de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.api.ner.type.Location`) and the names used in brat tend to be short 
(e.g. `LOC`), an explicit mapping is usually required. This mapping can be provided as JSON which
needs to be passed to the `PARAM_MAPPINGS` parameter of the `BratReader`. Note that the parameter
takes actual JSON, not the path to a JSON file.

The mapping file consists of five sections: *text type mapping*, *relation type mapping*, *span mapping*, *relation mapping* and *comment mapping*.

.Mappings JSON file: high-level structure
[source,json]
----
{
  'textTypeMapppings': [ ... ],
  'relationTypeMapppings': [ ... ],
  'spans': [ ... ],
  'relations': [ ... ],
  'comments': [ ... ]
}
----

.Type mappings
The *type mappings* (span and relation) indicates how to find the UIMA type for a given brat annotation. Each type mapping contains two mandatory fields:

* `from`: this field is a regular expression which matches the annotation name used by brat. Note that dashes (`-`) in the brat name must be replaced by dots (`.`) or escaped dots (`\.`) to match here! It is also possible to match multiple brat annotations at once using regular expressions such as `(PER|LOC)` or `.*-LOC`.
* `to`: this is the UIMA type to map to.

The order of the mappings matter - brat annotations are matched to them in the order they are
defined in the mappings file. This allows e.g. to put a *catch-all* mapping at the end with 
`'from': '.*'` which would match all brat annotations not matched by a previous mapping. 

.Mapping text annotations
For the purpose of mapping, brat event (`E`) and text (`T`) annotations are both considered
*text type annotations*.

.Example: Mapping brat text-type annotations to UIMA types
[source,json]
----
{
  'textTypeMapppings': [
    {
      'from': 'LOC',
      'to': 'de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.api.ner.type.Location'
    },
    {
      'from': 'PER',
      'to': 'de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.api.ner.type.Person'
    },
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
----

In addition to the `textTypeMapppings` section, there is a `spans` section. This can be used
to further configure any annotations of a given UIMA type that are created by the reader. In
addition to the `defaultFeatureValues` (see futher below) option, there is the option to store original
brat annotation name in a feature indicated by `subCatFeature`. The example below stores the name of
the brat annotation into the `value` feature of the `NamedEntity` type.

.Example: Span mappings
[source,json]
----
{
  'spans': [
    {",
      'type': 'de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.api.ner.type.NamedEntity',
      'subCatFeature': 'value',
      'defaultFeatureValues': {
        'identity': 'none'
      }",
   }",
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
----

.Mapping events
Event annotations (`E`) from brat are basically treated like text annotations (`T`). However, events
can have multiple arguments in brat and these arguments point to other annotations. The `BratReader`
will try to store these argument values in the target UIMA type in corresponding feature values.

For example if the brat file contains an event annotation as shown below, the target UIMA type for 
the brat `pred` annotation should have a feature `subject` and a feature `object` which would be able
to accept the type of annotation to which the brat `entity` annotation is mapped.

[source,brat]
----
T1 pred 5 10	likes
T2 entity 0 4	John
T3 entity 11 16	pizza
E1 pred:T1 subject:T2 object:T3
----

.Mapping relations
Relation annotations can be mapped in the same way.

.Example: Mapping brat relation annotations to UIMA types
[source,json]
----
{
  'relationTypeMapppings': [
    {
      'from': 'nsubj|obj|iobj',
      'to': 'de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.api.syntax.type.dependency.Dependency'
    },
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
----

In addition to the `textTypeMapppings` section, there is a `relations` section. Here, the features used
to represent the relation end points can be configured. The example matches all brat relation
annotations which have been mapped to the `Dependency` UIMA type. The first argument from the brat
relation is mapped to the `source` feature while the second argument is mapped to the `target`
feature. The option `flags1` or `flags2` can be set to `A` to indicate that either the offsets of the
first or second argument are used as the offsets of the created UIMA annotation. Also, the
`subCatFeature` and `defaultFeatureValues` already mentioned for the span mappings are supported.

.Example: Mapping brat relation annotations to UIMA types
[source,json]
----
{
  'relations': [
    {
      'type': 'de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.api.syntax.type.dependency.Dependency',
      'arg1': 'source',
      'arg2': 'target',
      'flags2': 'A',
      'subCatFeature': 'DependencyType',
      'defaultFeatureValues': {
        'flavour': 'basic'
      }
    },
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
----

.Mapping brat comments to UIMA
The *comment* field of annotations is the only free text field in brat (all others have a
controlled vocabulary). Sometimes the field is indeed used for comments. But sometimes, the
field is also used to store actual tags. In order to map comments to UIMA, a `comments`
section needs to be added to the mapping file. A comment mapping then consists of these
items:

* `type`: the name of a UIMA type to which the brat annotation was matched.
* `feature`: the feature of the UIMA type where the comment value should be stored
* `match` (optional): a regular expression indicating when to use this mapping rule.
* `replace` (optional): can be used to modify the value stores in the UIMA feature. If the
  `match` field includes capturing groups in its regular expression, these can be accessed
  here e.g. using `$1`. This can be used to normalize values.

Mind that the same type can appear multiple times if the comment field should be mapped
to different features depending on the comment value. The example below maps the comment
value to the `value` feature if the comment is `PER`, `LOC`, `ORG` or `MISC`. However, if
the value field is a URL, then the comment is mapped into the `identifier` feature.

.Example: Mapping brat relation annotations to UIMA types
[source,json]
----
{
  'comments': [
    {
      'type': 'de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.api.ner.type.NamedEntity',
      'feature': 'value',
      'match': '^(PER|LOC|ORG|MISC)$',
    },
    {
      'type': 'de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.api.ner.type.NamedEntity',
      'feature': 'identifier',
      'match': '^http://.*$'
    },
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
----


.Default feature values (text-type and relation annotations)
It may be desirable to set certain UIMA features as part of the conversion. E.g. when
reading dependency relation annotations, it may be useful to set the `flavour` feature
of the DKPro Core `Dependency` type to `basic`. This can be done by adding a 
`defaultFeatureValues` section to the mapping.


.Example: Default feature values
[source,json]
----
{
  'relationTypeMapppings': [
    {
      'from': 'nsubj|obj|iobj',
      'to': 'de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.api.syntax.type.dependency.Dependency',
      'defaultFeatureValues': {
        'flavour': 'basic'
      }
    },
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
----

Another use-case of default feature values is if the brat annotation label is actually a
concatenation of multiple tags which should be split up into multiple features at the UIMA
level:

.Example: Multiple default feature values 
[source,json]
----
{
  'textTypeMapppings': [
    {
      'from': 'top-left',
      'to': 'custom.Direction',
      'defaultFeatureValues': {
        'horizontal': 'left',
        'vertical': 'top'
      }
    },
    {
      'from': 'bottom-right',
      'to': 'custom.Direction',
      'defaultFeatureValues': {
        'horizontal': 'right',
        'vertical': 'bottom'
      }
    },
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
----

.Segmentation
Note that the brat annotation format does not have a built-in concept of token or sentence
boundaries. So unless these are explicitly annotated in the brat file and mapped to the DKPro Core
`Token` and `Sentence` types, there will not be any such annotations available. If you apply a
segmenter component (e.g. the DKPro Core  `BreakIteratorSegmenter`) to the output of the reader you 
will get token and sentence boundaries, but they *might* not coincide with the annotations boundaries
read from the brat file. Your mileage may vary.
