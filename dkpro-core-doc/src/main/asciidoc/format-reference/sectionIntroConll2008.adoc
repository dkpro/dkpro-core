The CoNLL 2008 format targets syntactic and semantic dependencies. Columns are tab-separated. Sentences are separated by a blank new line.

.Columns
[cols="1,2,3", options="header"]
|====
| Column  | Type/Feature | Description

| ID      
| ignored 
| Token counter, starting at 1 for each new sentence.

| FORM    
| Token 
| Word form or punctuation symbol.

| LEMMA   
| Lemma 
| Lemma of the word form.

| GPOS  
| POS PosValue 
| Golf fine-grained part-of-speech tag, where the tagset depends on the language.

| PPOS
| ignored
| Automatically predicted major POS by a language-specific tagger.

| SPLIT_FORM   
| ignored 
| Tokens split at hyphens and slashes.

| SPLIT_LEMMA
| ignored
| Predicted lemma of SPLIT_FORM.

| PPOSS
| ignored
| Predicted POS tags of the split forms.

| HEAD    
| Dependency 
| Head of the current token, which is either a value of ID or zero (`0). Note that depending on the original treebank annotation, there may be multiple tokens with an ID of zero.

| DEPREL  
| Dependency 
| Dependency relation to the HEAD. The set of dependency relations depends on the particular language. Note that depending on the original treebank annotation, the dependency relation may be meaningful or simply `ROOT`.

| PRED
| SemPred
| (sense) identifier of a semantic 'predicate' coming from a current token.

| APREDs
| SemArg
| Columns with argument labels for each semantic predicate (in the ID order).
