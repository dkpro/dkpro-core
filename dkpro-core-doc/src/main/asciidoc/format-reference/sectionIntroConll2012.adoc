The CoNLL 2012 format targets semantic role labeling and coreference. Columns are tab-separated. Sentences are separated by a blank new line.

.Columns
[cols="1,2,3", options="header"]
|====
| Column  | Type/Feature | Description

| Document ID
| ignored
| This is a variation on the document filename.</li>

| Part number
| ignored
|  Some files are divided into multiple parts numbered as 000, 001, 002, ... etc.

| Word number
| ignored
| </li>

| Word itself
| document text
|  This is the token as segmented/tokenized in the Treebank. Initially the `*_skel` file contain the placeholder `[WORD]` which gets replaced by the actual token from the Treebank which is part of the OntoNotes release.

| Part-of-Speech
| POS
| 

| Parse bit
| Constituent
| This is the bracketed structure broken before the first open parenthesis in the parse, and the word/part-of-speech leaf replaced with a `*`. The full parse can be created by substituting the asterix with the `([pos] [word])` string (or leaf) and concatenating the items in the rows of that column.

| Predicate lemma
| Lemma
|  The predicate lemma is mentioned for the rows for which we have semantic role information. All other rows are marked with a "-".

| Predicate Frameset ID
| SemPred
| This is the PropBank frameset ID of the predicate in Column 7.

| Word sense
| ignored
| This is the word sense of the word in Column 3.

| Speaker/Author
| ignored
| This is the speaker or author name where available. Mostly in Broadcast Conversation and Web Log data.

| Named Entities
| NamedEntity
| These columns identifies the spans representing various named entities.

| Predicate Arguments
| SemPred
| There is one column each of predicate argument structure information for the predicate mentioned in Column 7.

| Coreference
| CoreferenceChain
| Coreference chain information encoded in a parenthesis structure.
