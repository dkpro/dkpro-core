One of the official formats supported by UIMA is the XMI format. It is an XML-based format that does
not support a few very specific characters which are invalid in XML. But it is able to capture all
the information contained in the CAS. The XMI format is the de-facto standard for exchanging data
in the UIMA world. Most UIMA-related tools support it.

The XMI format does not include type system information. It is therefore recommended to always
configure the XmiWriter component to also write out the type system to a file.

If you with to view anntated documents using the UIMA CAS Editor in Eclipse, you can e.g. set up
your XmiWriter in the following way to write out XMIs and a type system file:

[source,java]
----
AnalysisEngineDescription xmiWriter = 
  AnalysisEngineFactory.createEngineDescription(
      XmiWriter.class, 
      XmiWriter.PARAM_TARGET_LOCATION, ".",
      XmiWriter.PARAM_TYPE_SYSTEM_FILE, "typesystem.xml");  
----
