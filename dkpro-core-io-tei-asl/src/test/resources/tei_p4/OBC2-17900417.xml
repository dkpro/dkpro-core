To day my friend, Mr. Garrow, and myself, are counsel for the defendant, Mr. Frith: and though we are furnished with what we think a sufficient defence, yet we should feel ourselves deficient, if while we thought so, there was other evidence that could be brought forward; and we think there is some very important evidence which might be procured before the next sessions, on behalf of Mr. Frith: on that account, we, as counsel for him, apply to the humanity of the Attorney General, to beg he would consent to the postponing this trial to the next sessions. In this case we exercise our duty as counsel: Mr. Frith is entitled to the best of our judgment: whether he will chuse to be guided that, is certainly a consideration for his own mind. Mr. Attorney General always will attend to applications of this sort; we therefore do hope that he will consent.</u></p>

I then shall make an application as being illegally detained in prison, that you will not admit a British subject to plead to the indictment: I therefore shall make an application to the legislature, that you are violating the laws of this kingdom.

The justice of the law has provided a remedy in such cases; therefore I think there ought now to be an enquiry made, touching the sanity of this man at this time; whether he is in a situation of mind to say what his grounds of defence here are. I know it is untrodden ground, though it is constitutional: then get a jury together to enquire into the present state of his mind: the twelve men that are there, will do.</u></p>

On the 22d of January, I came into these circumstances: and they were pleased to send the king's physician to examine me, whether I was perfectly in my senses: I persevered in being so, and would take no drugs from the apothecary. I begged him to attend as a friend to me, to protect me from insult, supposing there was any possibility that I could be insulted in this great prison: but if I had not been well, I would have had my own physician, Dr. Heberden, who attended my father formerly, when living: I looked upon him as a friend attending me, to prove that I was in my senses, or any thing else. I made memorandums of his visits, and the various conversations that we had together. I made memorandums likewise of letters: a letter which I wrote to Mess. Cox and Greenwood; and I have a copy of it, and one that I wrote about the 24th of February, during the time that the last sessions was here, when I thought I might be tried; I then recopied it again. I then mentioned that a disagreeable thing had happened, that General Clarke is coming home in disgrace. To hide that infamy that has happened, they wished to give it out that I was out of my senses. The agents who had immediately freed me from the inconveniences I was under, they were ordered to deny the subject the liberty of drawing on his agent on the house where he had money to answer his bills. They acknowledged me to have been perfectly in my senses at the time when I first came to England; I drew on them, and I have totally freed myself from the inconvenience I was under, from being improperly detained in the county of Cheshire. I was writing a letter of what was publickly given out concerning the subject: I then wrote to Mess. Cox, Cox and Greenwood, to beg they would send down some gentlemen here, to prove how the liberty of the subject was invaded in 1787, in June; and such letters will prove, that the 24th of last February, I was right in my mind then; and that now I recopied it again about a fortnight ago: and it went through my attorney, to Mess. Cox, Cox and Greenwood's house: that will prove the state of my mind at that period of time.</u></p>
